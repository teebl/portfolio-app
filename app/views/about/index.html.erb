<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>In August 2017, Trevor began his journey into programming. His passion for building websites grew rapidly, and what started with a few online courses soon evolved into personal projects, attending Ottawa JavaScript meetups, and eventually presenting at them. Now, Trevor is employed full-time as a software developer, often working in a full-stack capacity.</p>

<p>Before the career change, Trevor worked as a woodworker, preserving Canadian history in the nation's capital. Trevor is a graduate of Algonquin College's Heritage Carpentry and Joinery program.</p>

<p>The career change might seem like quite the leap, but woodworking and coding share many skill sets. Order of operations, resource management, and a focus on product delivery are vital assets for both disciplines.</p>

<p>Trevor primarily writes code in TypeScript and Ruby on Rails.</p>
