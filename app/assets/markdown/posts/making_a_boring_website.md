Earlier this year I decided to make a new portfolio site, and it's given me an opportunity to reflect on the changes in my sensibilities as a developer. You're reading on the new site now.

I've grown in many ways, and have a keener eye as a developer. Under the hood especially, there's a lot I'd have done differently. Something I still appreciate from the old site is the minimal design. It is selective in what tries to get your attention.

The new site, the one you're on, shares that minimalist sensibility. The new site takes it even further, even at the cost of flashiness. There's no animation, no novel navbar. Most laymen would probably point at the old site as the more 'impressive', so why am I happier with the new site than with the old?

The answer is that I now take the spirit of that minimalist sensibility, and extend it to my development style.

I've got some indulgences, to facilitate of ease-of-use: I've written the site in Ruby on Rails, a massive tool in terms of what I'm trying to accomplish, but writing in Rails is second nature to me at this point. Counterintuitively, going for a basic HTML/CSS static webpage runs the risk of costing more [innovation tokens](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) thans it's worth. I've also added the functionality to process markdown files into HTML. When it comes to writing from thought, I've favoured markdown over HTML for some time. 

Now, after six more years writing code, my approach has shifted from 'what impressive tech can I leverage', to 'what is the simplest thing that delivers on what I need'. This asceticism fuels my best work.

Dieter Rams, possibly the most famous designer alive, says it best: *The best design is as little design as possible*. The more contrivances and inventions and attention-grabbing elements available, the harder it is to capture the message at the core of any product, statement, or endeavour. 

The minimalist approach comes with many benefits. The new site runs without the need for JavaScript, unlike the old. It was painless to develop, and is just as capable in terms of future additions. With wise limitations to my development approach, I've gained more flexibility, as well as more time.

This journey from feature-rich to feature-appropriate has fundamentally changed how I approach development. Where I once reached for the newest frameworks, I now ask "what's the simplest solution that solves the problem?" Where I once added animations for visual interest, I now consider whether they serve the content.

Minimalism isn't about doing less - it's about doing exactly what's needed, and doing it well. In web development as in design, the most powerful statements often come from what we choose *not* to include.
