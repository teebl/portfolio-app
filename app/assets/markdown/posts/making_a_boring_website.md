Earlier this year I decided to make a new portfolio site, and it's given me an opportunity to reflect on the changes in my sensibilities as a developer. You're reading on the new site now.

I've grown in many ways, and have a keener eye as a developer. Under the hood especially, there's a lot I'd have done differently. One standout aspect I like from the old site is the minimal design. It is selective in what tries to get your attention.

The new site, the one you're on, shares that minimalist sensibility. The new site takes it even further, even at the cost of flashiness. There's no animation, no novel navbar. Most laymen would probably point at the old site as the more 'impressive', so why am I happier with the new site than with the old?

The answer is that I now take the spirit of that minimalist sensibility, and extend it to my development style. Basically, I'm now walking the walk of minimalism.

I'm building in Ruby on Rails, instead of React, and skipping any animations. I'm withholding [innovation tokens](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) by refraining from adding any custom blog-post friendly frameworks, like Jekyll, or even external CSS packages.

I've got one indulgence: I've added the functionality to process markdown files into HTML. When it comes to writing from thought, I've favoured markdown over HTML for some time.

Now, some 5 or 6 years on from starting as a developer, my approach has shifted from 'what impressive tech can I leverage', to 'what is the simplest thing that delivers on what I need'. This asceticism fuels my best work.

Dieter Rams, possibly the most famous designer alive, says it best: *The best design is as little design as possible*. The more contrivances and inventions and attention-grabbing elements available, the harder it is to capture the message at the core of any product, statement, or endeavour.
