# about me

In August 2017, Trevor began his journey into programming. His passion for building websites grew rapidly, and what started with a few online courses soon evolved into personal projects, attending Ottawa JavaScript meetups, and eventually presenting at them. Now, Trevor is employed full-time as a software developer, often working in a full-stack capacity.

Before the career change, Trevor worked as a woodworker, preserving Canadian history in the nation's capital. Trevor is a graduate of Algonquin College's Heritage Carpentry and Joinery program.

It might seem like quite the leap, but woodworking and coding share many skill sets. Order of operations, resource management, and a focus on product delivery are vital assets for both disciplines.

Trevor primarily codes using TypeScript and Ruby on Rails.
